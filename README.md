# Description
The purpose of this project is to be able to have a database of items that is stored in an MYSQL database but is connected through express and utilizes sequellze to create the seeded data for the database. Then once the data is seeded into the database, we use  sequelize to create models of each table so that CRUD statements can be made on server instead of having to make then in mysql and utilizing insomnia to use CRUD statements to update the database as needed. Throughout this project I originally had difficulty when it came to the routes and how to properly code the routes so that it would work on insomnia. 

# Technologies
